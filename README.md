<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Daniel Grabczewski</h1>

<h3>ISTQB-certified Software Tester with a strong software development background</h3>

I specialise in **manual QA, data integrity validation, and evidence-driven testing**, with hands-on experience validating real systems across UI, API, and persistence layers.

My background in software development helps me:
- Test systems at the **state and data level**, not just the UI  
- Design **high-value test cases** around real failure modes  
- Communicate defects clearly with **technical accuracy and reproducible evidence**

---

## 🔍 QA Focus Areas

- Manual functional testing (UI, API, persistence)
- Data integrity & state validation (DB / localStorage)
- API contract testing (Postman)
- End-to-end checkout, ordering, and money-path reliability
- Defect reporting with clear repro steps and supporting artefacts
- Structured QA documentation (test plans, test cases, summary reports, regression checklists)

## 🧪 Selected QA Projects

**Ticketer — QA (Ordering & Persistence)**  
Manual testing of drag-and-drop ordering in a Kanban app, with backend verification using MySQL.  
Focused on persistence, ordering integrity, and multi-step user interactions.  


**Boba Business Management — QA (Checkout, Orders & Stock)**  
UI-to-localStorage verification of checkout reliability, order creation rules, and stock integrity in a client-only SPA.
